    "technicalSummary": "Artemisinin-based combination therapies are the frontline drugs for the treatment of malaria infections, but, for Plasmodium falciparum, the efficacy of artemisinin is threatened by the spread of resistance. Plasmodium vivax is the second most common cause of human malaria, but there is little information on its susceptibility to artemisinin due to the lack of an in-vitro culture system. This study aims to characterise the response of P vivax to artesunate using clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data from infected individuals in Cambodia.\n\nWe analysed 161 P vivax infections from 87 patients (six female and 81 male; median age 20 years [IQR 17-26]) enrolled between Nov 10, 2021, and Nov 1",

    "technicalSummary": "Emerging evidence underscores bidirectional communication along the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the field lacks dedicated metagenomic resources with standardized phenotyping for these conditions. Existing single-cohort studies face inherent limitations due to restricted sample sizes, confounding heterogeneity, and methodological fragmentation, compromising reproducibility and mechanistic insights. To overcome these challenges, we constructed the Gut Microbiome in Multinational Integrated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (GutMIND) database, a comprehensive resource integrating shotgun metagenomic data with harmonized metadata.

We developed and validated a polygenic score (PGS) for osteoporosis in a Japanese population using heel quantitative ultrasound-derived T-scores.
