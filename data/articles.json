    "technicalSummary": "Artemisinin-based combination therapies are the frontline drugs for the treatment of malaria infections, but, for Plasmodium falciparum, the efficacy of artemisinin is threatened by the spread of resistance. Plasmodium vivax is the second most common cause of human malaria, but there is little information on its susceptibility to artemisinin due to the lack of an in-vitro culture system. This study aims to characterise the response of P vivax to artesunate using clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data from infected individuals in Cambodia.\n\nWe analysed 161 P vivax infections from 87 patients (six female and 81 male; median age 20 years [IQR 17-26]) enrolled between Nov 10, 2021, and Nov 1",

    "laymansExplanation": "Most people think longevity is about one supplement or one biomarker. In reality, your baseline strength and muscle are foundational. Muscle helps regulate blood sugar, supports mobility, protects against falls, and improves how resilient your body is when stress hits. This research suggests resistance training is one of the most practical long-term health strategies because it compounds over time.",
