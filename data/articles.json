    "technicalSummary": "Artemisinin-based combination therapies are the frontline drugs for the treatment of malaria infections, but, for Plasmodium falciparum, the efficacy of artemisinin is threatened by the spread of resistance. Plasmodium vivax is the second most common cause of human malaria, but there is little information on its susceptibility to artemisinin due to the lack of an in-vitro culture system. This study aims to characterise the response of P vivax to artesunate using clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data from infected individuals in Cambodia.\n\nWe analysed 161 P vivax infections from 87 patients (six female and 81 male; median age 20 years [IQR 17-26]) enrolled between Nov 10, 2021, and Nov 1",

Currently available dementia medications do not alter the disease course. Therefore, it is critically important to identify effective strategies for helping older Veterans living with dementia to enhance their functional status and quality of life.
